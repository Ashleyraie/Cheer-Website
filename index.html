  <p>Cheer is a sport involving the performance of organized cheering, chanting, stunting, and dancing in support of a sports team at games and particapte in competitons.</p>
  <p id="sentence2">Cheer is widely considered to not be a “real sport” and has never gotten the recognition it deserves even after it was offically made into an Olympic sport. A lot of poeple are mislead into believeing cheer isn't a sport because its a predominantly female sport. However, cheerleaders have to go through rigorous training and practice all the time to perfect the routines displayed at games and competitions. Being a cheerleader myself I’m able to vouch for the cheer community, there’s more to cheer than just yelling your “ABC’s” cheer takes a lot of time and dedication.</p>
